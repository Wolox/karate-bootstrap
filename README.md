## Karate DSL - Cucumber

=================

KarateDSL-cucumber : Automation API Test

Karate is the only open-source tool to combine API test-automation, mocks, performance-testing and even UI automation into a single, unified framework. 
The BDD syntax popularized by Cucumber is language-neutral, and easy for even non-programmers. Powerful JSON & XML assertions are built-in, and you can run tests in parallel for speed.

* **test/_java/_runner** - Here we define the runner thats execute all features in parallel and generate report
* **resources/_karate/_features/example.feature** - A feature would describe the current test script which has to be executed. (files .feature of the endpoint ext) goes here
* **resources/_karate/_services/_dao/_data/_query** - you can define the layers and database connections in case there were
* **resources/_karate/_support/** - A feature would describe the current test script which has to be executed. (files .feature of the enpoint health ext) goes here
* **resources/_karate/_support/_schemas** - Define all schemas of response to use in the features_endpoint
* **resources/_karate/_support/_json** - Define all .json to use in the features and env_data.json we define all the environment variables to be used throughout the project
* **/karate-config.js** - here we define all the environment variables to be used throughout the project
